# ATM_System

# ATM System

A simple **ATM (Automated Teller Machine) simulation** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
This project demonstrates basic ATM-like operations through a clean, interactive web interface.

---

## 🚀 Features

* Clean and simple UI
* Balance check functionality
* Deposit & Withdraw simulations
* Basic session-style interaction
* Fully frontend-based (no backend required)

---

## 📁 Project Structure

```
ATM_System/
│── index.html       # Main User Interface
│── style.css        # Styling for the UI
└── script.js        # Core ATM logic (balance, withdraw, deposit)
```

---

## 🧩 How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iamshubhdeep/ATM_System.git
```

2. **Open the folder**

```bash
cd ATM_System
```

3. **Run the project**

Just open **index.html** in any browser.
(No server needed.)

## 🛠 How It Works

* The entire logic runs in `script.js`
* Balance and operations are stored in memory (reset on refresh)
* No backend or database — ideal for learning purposes
* Great for beginners practicing JavaScript fundamentals

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

* No real authentication (PIN, multi-account, etc.)
* Data is not saved — refresh = reset
* Only a simulation, not a real banking application

---

## 🌱 Future Enhancements

* Add PIN-based login
* Add transaction history
* Add localStorage-based persistent balance
* Improve UI/UX
* Add backend + database for real account handling
